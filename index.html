          Happy Birthday to you PRITHVI !!! Wishing you a universe of happiness, a sky full of success, and an eternity of love.
          “It may be your birthday, but you’re a gift to me”. I just can't wait to meet you and give you a really long hug.
          Today, it's been 9 months and 2 days since I met you, and it makes me realize how fast the time flies. 
          Meeting you was the best accident that could happen to me. Do you remember, that day I told you I will be making a birthday website for my friend and you said, show me too whenever you make it? Never had thought ki that friend will be you only, moreover not just a friend now XD. So here it is &#128157;
